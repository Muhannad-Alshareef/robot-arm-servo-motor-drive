# robot-arm-servo-motor-driver
This project was made to drive 5 servo motors using an arduino for the purpose of creating a 4-axis robotic arm, as a part of smart methods association training program.\
The mostfet used can be an N-MOS IRFZ44n or similar, which is used to cutoff the power to preserve energy, it is controlled by the switch going to pin 2  of the arduino Uno.\
The switch used can be replaced with a signal coming from a wireless unit to power the motors using IoT.


Components used:\
1 Arduino Uno
5 IRFZ44N 
5 10k potentiometer
5 1k resistors
5 10k resistors
1 slide switch
